# Exportify: Spotify Playlist Backup and Export Utility

## Project Overview

Exportify is a web application designed to help Spotify users export and backup their playlists with ease. Built as a browser-based solution, it provides a user-friendly interface for exporting playlist data directly from Spotify without storing any user information.

### Core Purpose

The primary goal of Exportify is to solve a critical gap in Spotify's native functionality: the ability to export, archive, and backup playlists. By leveraging the Spotify Web API, users can quickly and securely create comprehensive CSV exports of their music collections.

### Key Features

- üì¶ **Complete Playlist Export**: Easily export individual or all Spotify playlists to CSV format
- üîç **Advanced Search**: Search and filter playlists using intuitive and advanced search syntax
- üìä **Detailed Track Metadata**: Export extensive track information including URIs, artist details, album information, and more
- üåê **Multilingual Support**: Available in 10 languages (English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Swedish, Dutch, Japanese, and Arabic)
- üåì **Dark Mode**: Comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments
- üì± **Mobile Friendly**: Full functionality across desktop and mobile devices

### Export Capabilities

Exportify offers flexible export options, allowing users to include additional metadata such as:
- Artist genres
- Audio features (danceability, energy, tempo, etc.)
- Album details (genres, label, copyrights)

### Key Benefits

- üîê **Privacy-First**: No user data is saved; everything runs in the browser
- üöÄ **Performance**: Optimized API handling for smooth, efficient exports
- üìã **Comprehensive Backup**: Create a complete, readable archive of your Spotify playlists

## Getting Started, Installation, and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18.18 or later)
- Yarn package manager

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/exportify.git
   cd exportify
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Development 

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
yarn start
```

The application will launch on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Build

To create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `build` directory.

### Docker Deployment

You can also run the application using Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t exportify .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 3000:3000 exportify
```

### Browser Compatibility

The application supports:

## Deployment

The documentation for the Deployment section will focus on the methods evident in the project files:

Docker Deployment:
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t exportify .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 3000:3000 exportify
```

GitHub Pages Deployment:
The project is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the master branch. The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` handles this process:
- Runs on Node.js 18.x
- Installs dependencies using Yarn
- Runs tests
- Builds the application
- Deploys the `build` directory to GitHub Pages

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x
- Yarn package manager
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Build Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build for production
yarn build

# Run tests before deployment
yarn test
```

### Deployment Platforms
- **GitHub Pages**: Automatic deployment on master branch
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment available
- **Hosting Compatibility**: Static hosting platforms like Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages are supported

### Environment Notes
- The application uses a static build process
- Requires no additional backend configuration
- Uses React Scripts for build and deployment

## Additional Notes

### API and Usage Considerations

- **Spotify API Limitations**: Spotify's Web API does not currently support retrieving playlist folders. Users should be aware that nested playlist structures may not be fully preserved during export.

### Performance and Responsibility

- **API Request Management**: The application implements advanced rate limiting to optimize Spotify API interactions. However, bulk exports of large numbers of playlists may take considerable time.
- **Responsible Usage**: Users are encouraged to use the export functionality judiciously to prevent potential API access issues.

### Data Privacy and Security

- **Browser-Based Processing**: All data processing occurs entirely in the user's browser. No playlist or track information is stored or transmitted to external servers.
- **Read-Only Access**: The application only requires read-only permissions to Spotify playlists, ensuring minimal risk to user account security.

### Compatibility and Internationalization

- **Multi-Language Support**: The application is available in 10 languages, including English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Swedish, Dutch, Japanese, and Arabic.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to be mobile-friendly and functional across different devices and screen sizes.

### Error Handling and Monitoring

- **Error Tracking**: Utilizes Bugsnag for monitoring and reporting application errors, helping to improve overall user experience and application stability.
